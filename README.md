# games
 
I want to create a more abstract puzzle-solving application. Additionally, I would like to classify/interpret games (and game states!). Finally, perhaps, build this into an app.

# TODO

- What kind of games? Overarching principles?
  - sudoku (variants) (formulate constraints, use LP?)
  - chess/checkers/three in a row (alpha-beta pruning, for chess stockfish-like eval, MCTS)
  - rubik's cubes?
- How to classify game?
  - some deep visual model
  - dataset?
- Interpret game state
  - recognize board/grid and use that information to manually separate grid squares
- Mobile app
